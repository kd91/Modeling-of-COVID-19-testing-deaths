# Modeling-of-COVID-19-testing-deaths
Exploration and Modeling of COVID-19 Data

In this project, our team seeks to address the following problem: whether it is possible to accurately predict country-wide or region-wise mortality rates for the COVID-19 pandemic, based on the total number of tests done for the population. We know that when a communicable disease outbreak begins, the ideal response for public health officials is to begin testing for it early. It leads to quick identification of cases, contact  tracing, quick treatment for those infected and immediate isolation to prevent spread. The testing numbers will help us develop a complete picture of the epidemiology and progression of COVID-19. We hope our findings will be important in learning how to handle future pandemics and infectious disease outbreaks.


For this project, we plan to design a model by comparing two countries (most likely, USA and South Korea). The countries will be compared using the following predictor variables: 

 The number of confirmed cases per million, 
 The number of tests performed per million, 
 Dates for each day since the 5th confirmed case in the country

Together, these variables will be used to predict the number of deaths for a country using regression models. 

Datasets: 
The dataset we will use to get the total number of tests per million date-wise can be found here (OurWorld dataset). : https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-19-tests-deaths-scatter-with-comparisons 
The dataset we will use to identify the number of confirmed cases and deaths can be found here: Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) - https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series
